Has this advice ceased to work in modern markets?  Are there other seasonal patterns in the broader market?  This analysis evaluates seasonal patterns on the S&amp;amp;P 500 from 1993 to present.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 20:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-07-13:/sell_in_may.html</guid><category>seasonality</category><category>market anomaly</category><category>SPY</category></item><item><title>Stock Prediction with ML: Feature Selection</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/feature_selection.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third post in my tutorial series on applying machine learning to stock prediction. This post is going to delve into the mechanics of feature selection - a critical step towards improving model robustness. This will cover a systematic approach for choosing between the many variations of features you've created during the feature engineering stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 20:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-07-12:/feature_selection.html</guid><category>tutorial</category><category>feature engineering</category></item><item><title>Stock Prediction with ML: Feature Engineering</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/feature_engineering.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post is going to delve into the mechanics of feature engineering for the sorts of time series data that you may use as part of a stock price prediction modeling system. I'll cover the basic concept, then offer some useful python code "recipes" for transforming your raw source data into features which can be fed directly into a ML algorithm or ML pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2018 20:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-07-09:/feature_engineering.html</guid><category>tutorial</category><category>feature engineering</category><category>pandas</category></item><item><title>Stock Prediction with ML: Data Management</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/data_management.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This first post of a tutorial on machine learning in finance will present a framework for organizing and working with data. Perhaps not the most electrifying of topics, but it's the foundation for later modeling tutorials. It's also of critical significance and importance. I've heard it said that 90% of time in real-world quant finance is spent on data rather than models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 20:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-07-05:/data_management.html</guid><category>tutorial</category><category>data</category><category>pandas</category></item></channel></rss>
