Summary: This final post in the six-part tutorial series presents an ensemble modeling technique called "stacked generalization".  This technique focuses on improving out-of-sample generalization of models, making it extremely well suited to messy, non-stationary, regime shifting markets.  Like the prior five parts of the series, this presents a practical framework for applying ML to real-world financial time series prediction problems.
