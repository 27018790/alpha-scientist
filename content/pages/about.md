Title: About The Alpha Scientist

I'm Chad, aka The Alpha Scientist.  I've created this blog to explore the intersection of my two professional passions: locating "alpha" in market inefficiencies and applying data science methods.

I know I'm not alone in these intersecting passions.  There is a fast-growing community of quants and data scientists working in this field.  If you're among them (and I assume you are since you're reading this!) I hope to connect.  I want to give back to the community by sharing many of my discoveries, and to learn from your perspectives.

A bit about me:  I'm a full-time quantitative trader who has been working on data analytics since before it was cool.  Prior to becoming a full-time quant, I built products and managed teams at software companies across Silicon Valley.  I've had a long-standing interest in finance (earned my CFA designation in 2008) and have dedicated myself to the challenge of applying data science to financial markets.

Prior to my tech/finance career, I studied engineering, computer science, and business at Northwestern University and MIT.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife and two young kids.  In between kids and markets, I love to ski, surf, kiteboard, sail, and occasionally sleep.
