Title: Consulting

If you are looking for help with your investment-related project, please reach out to me at <thealphascientist@gmail.com>.

Sample projects might include:
* Interrogating datasets to identify _real and robust_ alpha
* Building quantitative tools which enhance the decision-making process for discretionary/fundamental investors
* Helping to define a strategy and roadmap for "data-fying" your discretionary investment processes
* Evaluating and optimizing your trade execution quality (e.g., T-cost)
* Backtesting your strategy ideas
* Architecting a data pipeline
* Implementing an end-to-end framework for machine learning market predictions

I look forward to connecting with you and discussing your needs.  If it's an area where I believe I can help, I can outline what a sample scope might look like.  If it's outside of my expertise, I will do my best to direct you to the right resources.
