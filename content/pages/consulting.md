Title: Consulting

If you'd like to accelerate progress with your investment-related project, I'd like to help.


Project scopes might include:

>-  Interrogating datasets to identify _real and robust_ alpha
>-  Building quantitative tools which enhance the decision-making process for discretionary/fundamental investors
>-  Helping to define a strategy and roadmap for "data-fying" your discretionary investment processes
>-  Evaluating and optimizing your trade execution quality (e.g., T-cost)
>-  Backtesting your strategy ideas
>-  Architecting data pipelines and data stores
>-  Implementing an end-to-end framework for machine learning market predictions
>-  ... or custom requirements

I look forward to connecting with you and discussing your needs.  If it's an area where I believe I can help, I can outline what a scope might look like.  If I'm not the right fit for the project, I will do my best to point you in the right direction.
