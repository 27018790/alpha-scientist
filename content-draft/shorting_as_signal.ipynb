    "Going to cash in the first 10 days of each month actually _increased_ annualized returns (log) by about 0.60%, while simultaneously lowering capital employed and volatility of returns.

Risk-adjusted returns would be significantly improved by only participating in the most favorable periods.  It's for each investor to decide what's important to them.  \n",
