    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of machine learning in the quantitative investment field is, by all indications, skyrocketing.  The proliferation of easily accessible data - both traditional and alternative - along with some very approachable frameworks for machine learning models - is encouraging many to explore the arena.\n",
    "\n",
    "These financial ML explorers are learning that there are many ways in which using ML to predict financial time series differs greatly from labeling cat pictures or flagging spam.  Application of machine learning to financial time series prediction is made especially difficult due to (1) non-stationarity, (2) low signal-to-noise, and (3) strong feature collinearity within financial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, even the most expertly designed ML models will achieve accuracy levels which would seem wholly inadequate in other domains.  It's hard to get excited about an RSQ of 0.10 or a classification accuracy of 0.60, but that is often the reality of well-built models in the domain of asset price prediction.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In my view, the generic model performance metrics (RSQ, MSE, accuracy, F1, etc...) are not tremendously useful when working in this domain.  Similarly, the traditional quantitative finance metrics (CAGR, sharpe, maxDD, etc...) do not provide as much insight into the models themselves as they do into the particular time period of data used.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, I've developed a set of metrics which have proved useful for comparing and optimizing models.  These metrics attempt to measure model performance in terms of _predictive power_ but also in terms of _practicality_, a critically important dimension for those who actually intend to _use_ their models in the real world.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I will present a general outline of my approach and will demonstrate a few of the most useful metrics I've added to my standard \"scorecard\".  I look forward to hearing how others may think to extend the concept.  \n",

    "* __Noise:__ critically important but often ignored, the noise metric estimates how dramatically the model's predictions vary from one day to the next.  As you might imagine, a model which abruptly changes its mind every few days is much harder to follow (and much more expensive to follow) than one which is a bit more steady.    "
